# wooting-xpad-dkms
Linux xpad driver patched with support for Wooting analog keyboards

## Installing

You can get releases for Fedora from my [COPR](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kylegospo/wooting-keyboards/).

See also my package that provides the needed udev rules to configure this keyboard with [Wootility](https://next.wooting.io/wootility) [here](https://github.com/KyleGospo/wooting-udev-rules).
